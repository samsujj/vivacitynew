Policies and Procedures Incorporated into Promoter Agreement:<br /><br />

These Policies and Procedures are a key part of the Vivacity, a MAKEWAY Wellness Company, Agreement. They may be amended or altered at any time without prior notice at the discretion of Vivacity. Hereinafter referred to as “Vivacity” or the "Company".<br /><br />

Throughout these Policies, when the term Agreement is used, it refers to the VIVACITY Promoter Application and Agreement, Promoter Terms and Conditions, and these Policies and Procedures. These documents are incorporated by reference into the VIVACITY Promoter Agreement (all in their current form and as amended by VIVACITY).<br /><br />

It is your responsibility as a Promoter to read, understand, and follow the most current version of these Policies and Procedures. When sponsoring or enrolling a new Promoter, the sponsoring Promoter must provide the most current version of the Terms and Conditions and these Policies and Procedures to the prospect prior to his or her execution of the Promoter Agreement.<br /><br />

By enrolling as a Promoter, the Applicant acknowledges that all of these Policies and Procedures have been read, completely understood and accepted as valid and binding between themselves and the Company.<br /><br />

<h2>Purpose of Policies and Procedures</h2><br />

Vivacity is a direct sales company that markets products through you, our Independent Promoters. Your success and the success of your fellow Promoters are dependent upon the integrity of the men and women who market our products.<br /><br />

Vivacity Promoters are required to comply with the Agreement which VIVACITY may amend at its sole discretion from time to time, as well as all federal, state, and local laws governing their VIVACITY business and their conduct. Because you may be unfamiliar with many of these standards of practice, it is very important that you read and abide by the Agreement.<br /><br />

Please review the information in this manual carefully. This Agreement was created to explain and govern the relationship you, as an independent contractor and Promoter and VIVACITY. It also sets a standard for acceptable business conduct between both VIVACITY and you, and you and your community.<br /><br />

<b>Remember, once you enroll, you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of being a Promoter, and to comply and be bound by the Policies and Procedures. The Applicant and VIVACITY have entered into a binding contract on those terms to which both are obligated to comply and adhere.</b>

VIVACITY reserves the right to reject any applications for a new Promoter or applications for renewal.<br /><br />

<h2>Your Rights as a Promoter:</h2><br />

Promoters are authorized to sell the Company’s products and to participate in the Compensation Plan.<br /><br />

<b>Promoters may sponsor new Promoters to sell the Company’s products.</b>

<b>Independent Promoters may sell our products, with no territorial restrictions, in all countries where the Company has authorized the sale of its products.</b>

<b>There are no franchise or territorial restrictions on a Promoter with regard to sale, promotion or marketing of products and no franchise fees are required.</b>

<b>Promoters have the right to conduct business anywhere in the United States of America, without exclusivity.</b>

<h2>Vivacity Business Policies</h2><br />

<b><label>Promoter as an Individual</label> — The Company will recognize individuals as Independent Promoters. The enrolled Applicant shall be designated as the Independent Promoter.</b>

<b><label>Assumed Names</label> — A person or entity may apply under a legally registered assumed name (DBA), provided that the Applicant provides a contact name at the time of enrolling.</b>

<b><label>Multiple Promoterships</label> — A Promoter may operate or have an ownership interest, legal or equitable, as a sole proprietorship, partner, shareholder, trustee, or beneficiary, in only one VIVACITY business.</b>

<b><label>Promoter Individuals</label> — If any individual (including spouses) Promoter in any way with a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity (collectively Promoter individual) violates the Agreement, such action(s) will be deemed a violation by the entity, and VIVACITY may take disciplinary action against the entity.</b>

<b><label>Addition of Co-Applicants</label> — When adding a co-applicant (either an individual or a business entity) to an existing VIVACITY business, the Company requires both a written request as well as a properly completed Promoter Application and Agreement containing the applicant and co-applicant’s Social Security Numbers and signatures. To prevent the circumvention of Section 20 (regarding transfers and assignments of VIVACITY business), the original applicant must remain as a party to the original Promoter Application and Agreement. If the original Promoter wants to terminate his or her relationship with the Company, he or she must transfer or assign his or her business in accordance with Section 20. If this process is not followed, the business shall be canceled upon the withdrawal of the original Promoter. All bonus and commission checks will be sent to the address of record of the original Promoter. Please note that the modifications permitted within the scope of this paragraph do not include a change of sponsorship. Changes of sponsorship are addressed in Section 41, below. There is a $100.00 fee for each change requested, which must be included with the written request and the completed Promoter Application and Agreement. VIVACITY may, at its discretion, require notarized documents before implementing any changes to a VIVACITY business. Please allow thirty (30) days after the receipt of the request by VIVACITY for processing.</b>

<b><label>Promoter Number</label> — Each Promoter will be assigned a Promoter ID Number. This number must be used when ordering and corresponding with the Company.</b>

<b><label>Change of Address</label> — Promoters agree to report any change of mailing or e-mail address and/or telephone number(s) as soon as possible. Such changes can be made through the Internet at any time at <a mailto="customerservice@vivacitygo.com">customerservice@vivacitygo.com</a> or by calling Customer Service at <a tel="800.928.9401">800.928.9401</a> .</b>

<b><label>Changes to Promoter’s Business</label> — Each Promoter must immediately notify VIVACITY of all changes to the information contained on his or her Promoter Agreement. Promoters may modify their existing Promoter Agreement (i.e., change Social Security number to Federal I.D. number, or change the form of ownership from an individual proprietorship to a business entity owned by the Promoter) by submitting a written request, a properly executed Promoter Agreement, and appropriate supporting documentation.</b>

<b><label>Annual Renewal</label> — The term of the Promoter Agreement is one year from the date of its acceptance by VIVACITY. All Promoters must renew their Promoter status on an annual basis at a cost of $29.95. The renewal amount is due on or before the anniversary month the Promoter entered the program. Failure to renew in a timely manner will mean the loss by the Promoter of all rights, his/her removal from the Promoter Network, forfeiture of all unpaid overrides, bonuses and/or commissions, and loss of the Promoter’s personal group or organization.</b>

<b><label>Renewal Procedure</label> — If a Promoter is not renewed within 30 days after the anniversary month, the Promoter will be “Suspended.” All commissions, overrides and bonuses will be accumulated and held by the Company until the renewal is received. If the Promoter is not renewed by 60 days after the anniversary month, the Promoter will be terminated permanently and no commissions, overrides, and/or bonuses will be paid. Once terminated, the Promoter can reapply as a new Promoter after waiting six (6) months.</b>

<b><label>Business Records</label> — Promoters understand that income and profits are dependent upon the sale of products, and agree to maintain necessary business records regarding said products, including sales receipts. Further, Promoter agrees to complete, execute and file any and all reports and other forms required by any law or public authority with respect to the sale of the Company products and shall at all times abide by any and all federal, state or municipal laws and regulations which may be applicable.</b>

<b><label>Independent Contractor Status</label> — Promoters are independent contractors, and are not purchasers of a franchise or a business opportunity. The agreement between VIVACITY and its Promoters does not create an employer/employee relationship, agency, partnership, or joint venture between the Company and the Promoter. Promoters shall not be treated as an employee for their services or for Federal or State tax purposes. All Promoters are responsible for paying local, state, and federal taxes due from all compensation earned as a Promoter of the Company. The Promoter has no authority (expressed or implied), to bind the company to any obligation, and VIVACITY disclaims any liability for their actions in any respect. Each Promoter shall establish his or her own goals, hours, and methods of sale, so long as he or she complies with the terms of the Promoter Agreement, these Policies and Procedures, and applicable laws.</b>

<b><label>Minors</label> — A person who is recognized as a minor in his/her state of residence may not be a VIVACITY Promoter. Promoters shall not enroll or recruit minors into the VIVACITY program. Guardianships are considered a Business Entity, and must be documented by completing a VIVACITY Business Entity Registration Form with appropriate documentation attached.</b>

<h2>Business Entities</h2><br />

<b><label>Partnerships</label> — An Applicant wishing to do business under a Partnership must list the complete Partnership name as the designated Applicant. In addition, the Federal Tax Identification Number of the Partnership, a completed VIVACITY Business Entity Registration and the name of the partner who will be the responsible party for the Partnership must be provided.</b>

<b><label>Corporations</label> — Corporations wishing to be independent Promoters must provide the Federal Tax Identification Number of the Corporation, a completed VIVACITY Business Entity Registration and the name of the individual who will be the contact for the Corporation. In addition, a copy of the Charter or Articles of Incorporation, copies of Minutes authorizing the Corporation to be an Independent Promoter, a list of all officers and shareholders with names, addresses and telephone numbers of each, and the name of an individual as a Corporate representative who shall be the party to contact on behalf of the Independent Promoter’s Promotership must be sent to the Company with the newly-assigned Promoter ID Number attached.</b>

<b><label>Corporate and Partnership Guarantee for Owners</label> — Although the Company has offered Promoter the opportunity to conduct their Promoter Promoterships as Corporate or Partnership entities, it is agreed that since the Promoter’s Promotership entity is under the control of its owners or principals, the actions of individual owners as they may affect the Company and Promoter’s Promotership are critical to the Company’s business. Therefore, it is agreed that the actions of corporate shareholders, officers, directors, agents, or employees, which are in contravention to the Company’s policies, shall be attributable to the Corporate or Partnership entity. In addition to the foregoing, a properly completed VIVACITY Business Entity Registration must be submitted to VIVACITY. The Business Entity Registration must be signed by all of the shareholders or partners. All shareholders and all partners, as the case may be, are jointly and severally liable for any indebtedness or other obligations to VIVACITY arising out of the operation of VIVACITY Promotership by their corporation or partnership.</b>

<h2>Marriage and Promoter Promoterships</h2><br />

<b>Married Promoters’ Spouses (including common law spouses) are considered to be one Promotership, and, accordingly, one spouse may not sponsor the other. If either spouse is enrolled as a Promoter, the couple is considered to be one Promotership.</b>

<b>Existing Promoters who Choose To Marry — If existing unmarried Promoters decide to marry, each of their Promoterships may remain intact and in their existing downlines.</b>

<b>Separation of a VIVACITY Business — VIVACITY Promoters sometimes operate their VIVACITY businesses as husband-wife partnerships, regular partnerships or corporations. At such time as a marriage may end in divorce or a corporation or partnership (the latter two entities are collectively referred to herein as, entities.) may dissolve, arrangements must be made to assure that any separation or division of the business is accomplished so as not to adversely affect the interests and income of other businesses up or down the line of sponsorship. If the separating parties fail to provide for the best interests of other Promoters and the Company, VIVACITY will involuntarily terminate the Promoter Agreement and roll-up their entire organization pursuant to Section 37. During the pendency of a divorce or entity dissolution, the parties must adopt one of the following methods of operation:</b>

<div style="margin-left:40px">
    <b>One of the parties may, with consent of the other(s), operate the VIVACITY business pursuant to an assignment in writing whereby the relinquishing spouse, shareholders, partners or trustees authorize VIVACITY to deal directly and solely with the other spouse or non-relinquishing shareholder, partner or trustee.</b>

<b><label>Sponsorship Change</label> — If a Promoter elects to change sponsors, the change must first be preceded by a written resignation, followed by the Promoter’s remaining inactive for a period of 6 months.

The term “established business or personal relationship” means a prior or existing relationship formed by a voluntary two-way communication between a Promoter and a person, on the basis of: (a) an inquiry, application, purchase or transaction by the person regarding products offered by such Promoter; or (b) a personal or familial relationship, which relationship has not been previously terminated by either party.<br /><br />

Violation of this policy may result in sanctions against your Promoter Promotership including suspension or termination of your Promoter Promotership account.<br /><br />


<b><label>Web Pages</label> — If a Promoter desires to utilize an Internet web page to promote his or her business, he or she may do so through the company’s official Promoter web sites. Under no circumstances is a Promoter allowed to use the Company’s trade name, logos, trademarks, product names and/or copyrighted materials on any other website, or on-line publications.</b>


<b><label>Domain Names</label> — Promoters may not use or attempt to register any of VIVACITY’s trade names, trademarks, service names, service marks, product names, the Company’s name, or any derivative thereof, for any Internet domain name.</b>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<h2>Claims</h2><br />

<b>Income Claims — In their enthusiasm to enroll prospective Promoters, some Promoters are occasionally tempted to make income claims or earnings representations to demonstrate the inherent power of network marketing. This is counterproductive because new Promoters may become disappointed very quickly if their results are not as extensive or as rapid as the results others have achieved. At VIVACITY, we firmly believe that the VIVACITY income potential is great enough to be highly attractive, without reporting the earnings of others.<br /><br />

    Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission and several states have laws or regulations that regulate or even prohibit certain types of income claims and testimonials made by persons engaged in network marketing. While Promoters may believe it beneficial to provide copies of checks, or to disclose the earnings of themselves or others, such approaches have legal consequences that can negatively impact VIVACITY as well as the Promoter making the claim unless appropriate disclosures required by law are also made contemporaneously with the income claim or earnings representation. Because VIVACITY Promoters do not have the data necessary to comply with the legal requirements for making income claims, a Promoter, when presenting or discussing the VIVACITY opportunity or the VIVACITY Compensation Plan to a prospective Promoter, may not make income projections, income claims, or disclose his or her VIVACITY income (including the showing of checks, copies of checks, bank statements, or tax records). Hypothetical income examples that are used to explain the operation of the VIVACITY Compensation Plan, and which are based solely on mathematical projections, may be made to prospective Promoters, so long as the Promoter who uses such hypothetical examples makes clear to the prospective Promoter (s) that such earnings are hypothetical.</b>


<b>Furthermore, any profits or success resulting from activities as an Promoter will be based only on sales volume of products offered by the Company and the Promoter or his/her personal groups or organization. Any success achieved will be based completely upon the independent Promoter’s own efforts, commitment, and skill.</b>


<b>A Promoter understands and shall make it clear to any Promoters he/she may sponsor, that Promoters will not be successful merely in sponsoring others without substantial efforts being directed at retail sales. The Company believes firmly that the income potential is great enough to be highly attractive in reality without resorting to artificial and unrealistic projections.</b>


<b><label>Product Medical Claims</label> — Promoter understand and agree to represent that all Company products are sold as consumer items and not medical products. Promoter may not use words such as therapy, therapeutic, cures, heals, healing, speeds or promotes healing, claims of cures, healing or any other medical claims for specific ailments, reference to research and/or clinical studies, or any other statements not used in the Company’s literature.</b>




<b><label>Medical Treatment, Approval and Therapy</label> — Promoters understand that they will NOT say or imply that the products are FDA-approved, or discuss or suggest any diagnosis, evaluation, prognosis, description, treatment, therapy, or management or remedy of illness, ailment or disease. Promoters understand that the Company’s products are NOT offered or intended or considered as medicines or medical treatment for any disorder or disease, either mental or physical.</b>


<b><label>Governmental Endorsement</label> — Federal and state regulatory agencies do not approve or endorse network programs. Therefore, Promoters may not represent or imply, directly or indirectly, that the Company’s program has been approved or endorsed by any governmental agency.</b>


<b><label>Product Claims</label> — The Company assumes no responsibility and/or liability for any oral claims made by its Promoters, customers, employees or advocates. The Company assumes no responsibility and/or liability for any written claims made by its Promoters or customers.</b>


<b><label>Consistent and Accurate Statement</label> — Promoters must present statements about the Company’s products that are in accordance with the sales and training materials provided by the Company in the training materials, brochures, newsletters, etc. The Company has provided specific guidelines for presenting clear, consistent and accurate statements about the products. Promoters agree to follow these guidelines.</b>

<h2>Disputes and Policy Violations</h2><br />

<b><label>Grievances and Complaints</label> — When a Promoters has a grievance or complaint with another Promoters regarding any practice or conduct in relationship to their respective VIVACITY businesses, the complaining Promoters should first report the problem to his or her Sponsor who should review the matter and try to resolve it with the other party’s upline sponsor. If the matter cannot be resolved, it must be reported in writing to the Promoter Support Department at the Company. The Promoter Support Department will review the facts and attempt to resolve it.</b>


<b><label>Reporting Policy Violations</label> — Promoters observing a Policy violation by another Promoter should submit a written report of the violation directly to the attention of the VIVACITY Compliance Department. Details of the incidents such as dates, number of occurrences, persons involved, and any supporting documentation should be included in the report.</b>


<b><label>Arbitration</label> — Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the breach thereof, shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. If an Promoter files a claim or counterclaim against VIVACITY, he or she may only do so on an individual basis and not with any other Promoters or as part of a class or consolidated action. Promoters waive all rights to trial by jury or to any court. All arbitration proceedings shall be held in the City of Florence, Alabama, unless the laws of the state in which an Promoter resides expressly require the application of its laws, in which case the arbitration shall be held in the capital of that state. The parties shall be entitled to all discovery rights allowed under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. No other aspects of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be applicable to arbitration. There shall be one arbitrator, an attorney at law, who shall have expertise in business law transactions with a strong preference being an attorney knowledgeable in the direct selling industry, selected from the panel which the American Arbitration Panel provides. The prevailing party shall be entitled to receive from the losing party costs and expenses of arbitration, including legal and filing fees. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may, if necessary, be reduced to a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive any termination or expiration of the Agreement.</b>


<b>Nothing in these Policies and Procedures shall prevent VIVACITY from applying to and obtaining from any court having jurisdiction a writ of attachment, a temporary injunction, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other relief available to safeguard and protect VIVACITY’s interest prior to, during or following the filing of any arbitration or other proceeding or pending the rendition of a decision or award in connection with any arbitration or other proceeding.</b>

<h2>Termination</h2><br />

<b><label>Effect of Termination</label> — So long as a Promoter remains active and complies with the Terms and Conditions of the Promoter Agreement and these Policies and Procedures, VIVACITY shall pay commissions to such Promoter in accordance with the Compensation Plan. A Promoter’s bonuses and commissions constitute the entire consideration for the Promoter’s efforts in generating sales and all activities related to generating sales (including building a downline marketing organization). Following a Promoter’s non-renewal of his or her Promoter Agreement, termination for inactivity, or voluntary or involuntary termination of his or her Promoter Agreement (all of these methods are collectively referred to as termination), the former Promoter shall have no right, title, claim or interest to the marketing organization which he or she operated, or any commission or bonus from the sales generated by the organization. A Promoter whose business is terminated will permanently lose all rights as an Promoter. This includes the right to sell VIVACITY products and services and the right to receive future commissions, bonuses, or other income resulting from the sales and other activities of the Promoter’s former downline marketing organization. In the event of termination, Promoters agree to waive all rights they may have, including, but not limited to, property rights, to their former retail customers, to their former downline marketing organization, as well as prospective downline marketing organization members and retail customers, and to any bonuses, commissions, or other remuneration derived from the sales and other activities from his or her former downline marketing organization and former retail customers.</b>


<b>The former Promoter shall not hold himself or herself out as a VIVACITY Promoter and shall not have the right to sell VIVACITY products or services. A Promoter whose Promoter Agreement is terminated shall receive commissions and bonuses only for the last full pay period he or she was active prior to termination (less any amounts withheld during an investigation preceding an involuntary termination).</b>


<b><label>Termination Due to Inactivity</label> — It is the Promoter’s responsibility to lead his or her marketing organization with the proper example in personal production of sales to end consumers by complying with the sales volume requirements of the Compensation Plan. Without satisfying this requirement, the Promoter will lose his or her right to receive commissions from sales generated through his or her marketing organization. Therefore, Promoters who personally produce less than the required amount of Personal Volume (PV) as specified in the Compensation Plan for any pay period will not receive a commission for the sales generated through their marketing organization for that pay period. If a Promoter has not produced any personal sales, and has not maintained a Promoter website for a period of six consecutive calendar months, his or her Promoter Agreement shall be terminated for inactivity. The termination will become effective on the day following the last day of the 6th month of inactivity. VIVACITY will not provide written confirmation of termination.</b>


<b><label>Involuntary Termination</label> — A Promoter’s violation of any of the Terms and Conditions of the Promoter Agreement or these Policies and Procedures, including any amendments that may be made by VIVACITY in its sole discretion, including the involuntary termination of his or her Promoter Agreement. Termination shall be effective on the date on which written notice is mailed, return receipt requested, to the Promoter’s last known address, or when the Promoter receives actual notice of termination, whichever occurs first.</b>


<b><label>Voluntary Termination</label> — A participant in this network marketing plan has a right to cancel at any time, regardless of reason. Cancellation must be submitted in writing to the company at its principal business address. The written notice must include the Promoter’s signature, printed name, address, and Promoter I.D. Number.</b>


<b><label>Non-renewal</label> — A Promoter may also voluntarily terminate his or her Promoter Agreement by failing to renew the Agreement on its anniversary date.</b>


<b><label>Compression (Roll-Up) of Promoters</label> — When a vacancy occurs in an Organization due to the termination of a VIVACITY business, each Promoter below the terminated Promoter will roll up to sponsor of the terminated Promoter.</b>


<b><label>Promoter Returns on Starter Packs</label> — A new Promoter has 30 days from the order date of his / her Starter Kit in which to cancel the Promoter Application and receive a full refund of their enrollment fee and / or Starter Pack fee. The Promoter will receive a refund, less shipping and handling, upon VIVACITY receiving the Starter Pack with original products and materials in unopened, unused, and resalable condition as originally sent. VIVACITY will not issue a refund for a Starter Pack containing opened product. If a partial kit is returned, the wholesale price of the product less 10% restocking fee will be refunded. After 30 days, VIVACITY deems any new Promoter who has not returned the Starter Pack to have irrevocably accepted the Terms and Conditions of Promoter and any / all policies and procedures of VIVACITY, and to be bound thereby. No refunds of Starter Packs will be allowed after the 30-day period has expired.</b>


<b>Any refunds issued shall result in an offset to Promoters who receive commissions, overrides, and bonuses paid out by VIVACITY in conjunction with the original purchase.</b>


<b><label>Return of Product by Promoters</label> - A Promoter who returns product for a refund is deemed to voluntarily cancel their Promotership. A Promoter may replace damaged product, without jeopardizing their Promotership.</b>

<h2>General Provisions</h2><br />

<b><label>Non-disparagement</label> — VIVACITY wants to provide its Independent Promoters with the best products, compensation plan, and service in the industry. Accordingly, we value your constructive criticisms and comments. All such comments should be submitted in writing to the Promoter Support Department. While VIVACITY welcomes constructive input, negative comments and remarks made in the field by Promoters about the Company, its products, or financial plan serve no purpose other than to sour the enthusiasm of other VIVACITY Promoters. For this reason, and to set the proper example for their downline, Promoters must not disparage VIVACITY, other VIVACITY Promoters, VIVACITY’s products, the Compensation plan, or VIVACITY’s directors, officers, or employees. The disparagement of VIVACITY, other VIVACITY Promoters, VIVACITY’s products, the Compensation plan, or VIVACITY’s directors, officers, or employees constitutes a material breach of these Policies and Procedures. Any such disparaging activity will be deemed grounds for termination of the individual’s Promotership.</b>


<b><label>Updated Literature and Information</label> — Promoters are responsible for learning updated information pertaining to the Company and for disseminating that information to their organizations. New forms and literature may periodically replace old forms and literature. Once new forms and literature are available, old materials will cease to be effective and valid. Refer to the revision code at the bottom of each form and piece of literature to determine the most recent version.</b>


<b><label>Company Vendor Contact</label> — Promoters are not permitted to have direct or indirect contact with the Company’s trade vendors for the purposes of attempting to negotiate “special” terms for products, promotional items, sales literature, etc., or to interfere with the Company’s relationship with its vendors. Any such contact will be deemed grounds for termination of the individual’s Promotership.</b>


<b><label>Re-packaging and Re-labeling Prohibited</label> — Promoters may not re-package, re-label, refill or alter the labels on any VIVACITY products, information, materials or programs in any way. VIVACITY products must be sold in their original containers only. Such re-labeling or repackaging would likely violate federal and state laws, which could result in severe criminal penalties. You should also be aware that civil liability can arise when, as a consequence of the re-packaging or re-labeling of products, the persons using the products suffer any type of injury or their property is damaged.</b>


<b><label>Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation</label> — VIVACITY Promoters are free to participate in other, Promoter programs, multilevel or network marketing business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively network marketing). However, during the term of this Agreement, and for a period of three months following the termination of this Agreement, Promoters may not recruit other VIVACITY Promoters or Customers for any other Promoter programs, and/or another network marketing business. The term recruit means actual or attempted solicitation, enrollment, encouragement, or effort to influence in any other way, either directly or through a third party, another VIVACITY Promoter or customer to enroll or participate in another, Promoter program, multilevel marketing, network marketing or direct sales opportunity. This conduct constitutes recruiting even if the solicited Promoter does not join, or the solicited customer does not make a purchase. This conduct also constitutes recruiting if the Promoter’s actions are in response to an inquiry made by another Promoter or Customer. Promoters, who qualify for Sr. Executive compensation, will not be eligible to receive Sr. Executive compensation if they are participating in other Promoter programs, multilevel or network marketing business ventures or marketing opportunities (collectively network marketing).</b>


<b>During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one year following the termination of this Agreement, Promoters shall not approach, solicit, induce or entice any VIVACITY Promoter, customer, supplier, or employee to alter, in any way, his or her business or employment relationship with VIVACITY.</b>


<b>Promoters must not sell, or attempt to sell, any competing non-VIVACITY products or services to VIVACITY Promoters or Customers. Any product or services in the same generic category as a VIVACITY product or service is deemed to be competing (e.g., any Skin Care product is in the same generic category as VIVACITY’s Skin Care products, and is therefore a competing product, regardless of differences in cost, quality, or ingredients.)</b>


<b>Promoters may not display VIVACITY products or services with any other products or services in a fashion that might in any way confuse or mislead a prospective customer or Promoter into believing there is a relationship between the VIVACITY and non-VIVACITY products or services. Promoters may not offer the VIVACITY opportunity, products or services to prospective or existing Customers or Promoters in conjunction with any non-VIVACITY program, opportunity, product or service. Promoters may not offer any non-VIVACITY opportunity, products or services at any VIVACITY-related meeting, seminar or convention, or immediately following such event.</b>


<b>Promoter acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing provisions regarding Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation are necessary for VIVACITY to preserve and protect its valuable interests and agrees that such provisions shall survive the termination of the Agreement.</b>


<b><label>No Circumvention</label> — The Company, at its sole discretion, hereby reserves the right to take action or to refuse to take action such as may be necessary to ensure compliance with its Policies or applicable law. Specifically, the Company may refuse to honor certain Promoter requests or to take other preventative action in situations whereby the Company deems a Promoter is acting to circumvent compliance with the Policies or applicable law. The preceding is not the exclusive remedy, but is cumulative with all other remedies, which may be available to the Company at law or in equity.</b>


<b><label>Other Agreements</label> — The Promoter acknowledges and agrees that entering into this Agreement does not violate or breach any other agreement the Promoter may have with any other person or entity.</b>


<b><label>Indemnification</label> — A Promoter is fully responsible for all of his or her verbal and written statements made regarding VIVACITY products, services, and the VIVACITY Compensation Plan, which are not expressly contained in official VIVACITY materials. Promoters agree to indemnify VIVACITY and VIVACITY directors, officers, employees, and agents, and hold them harmless from any and all liability including judgments, civil penalties, refunds, attorney fees, court costs, or lost business incurred by VIVACITY as a result of the Promoter’s unauthorized representations or actions. This provision shall survive the termination of the Promoter Agreement.</b>


<b><label>Amendments</label> — Because federal, state and local laws, as well as the business environment, periodically change, VIVACITY reserves the right to amend the Agreement and its prices in its sole and absolute discretion. By signing the Promoter Agreement, a Promoter agrees to abide by all amendments or modifications that VIVACITY elects to make. Amendments shall be effective upon notice to all Promoters that the Agreement has been modified. Notification of amendments shall be published in official VIVACITY materials. The Company shall provide or make available to all Promoters a complete copy of the amended provisions by one or more of the following methods: (1) posting on the Company’s official web site; (2) electronic mail (e-mail). The continuation of a Promoter’s VIVACITY business or an Promoter’s acceptance of bonuses or commissions constitutes acceptance of any and all amendments.</b>


<b><label>Delays</label> — VIVACITY shall not be responsible for delays or failures in performance of its obligations when performance is made commercially impracticable due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. This includes, without limitation, strikes, labor difficulties, riot, war, fire, death, curtailment of a party’s source of supply, or government decrees or orders.</b>


<b><label>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue</label> — Jurisdiction and Venue of any matter not subject to arbitration shall reside in Florence, Alabama unless the laws of the state in which a Promoter resides expressly require the application of its laws. The Federal Arbitration Act shall govern all matters relating to arbitration. The law of the State of Alabama shall govern all other matters relating to or arising from the Agreement unless the laws of the state in which a Promoter resides expressly require the application of its laws.</b>


<b><label>Waiver</label> — The Company never gives up its right to insist on compliance with the Agreement and with the applicable laws governing the conduct of a business. No failure of VIVACITY to exercise any right or power under the Agreement or to insist upon strict compliance by a Promoter with any obligation or provision of the Agreement, and no custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms of the Agreement, shall constitute a waiver of VIVACITY’s right to demand exact compliance with the Agreement. Waiver by VIVACITY can be affected only in writing by an authorized officer of the Company. VIVACITY’s waiver of any particular breach by a Promoter shall not affect or impair Promoter’s rights with respect to any subsequent breach, nor shall it affect in any way the rights or obligations of any other Promoter. Nor shall any delay or omission by VIVACITY to exercise any right arising from a breach affect or impair VIVACITY’s rights as to that or any subsequent breach.<br /><br />

    The existence of any claim or cause of action of a Promoter against VIVACITY shall not constitute a defense to VIVACITY’s enforcement of any term or provision of the Agreement.</b>


<b><label>Indemnification</label> — The Promoter agrees to hold the Company harmless from, and to indemnify it as regards, any loss, cause of action, litigation, claim, debt, judgment, attachment, execution, demand, cost (including but not limited to attorneys’ fees) or other obligation of any kind arising out of the Independent Promoter’s acts, words, conduct or omission as an independent contractor for the sale of Company products.</b>


<b><label>Notice</label> — Any communication, notice or demand of any kind whatsoever which either the Promoter or the Company may be required or may desire to give or to serve upon the other shall be in writing and delivered by telex, telegram, e-mail or facsimile (if confirmed in writing sent by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested or by personal service), or by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, or by personal service. Any party may change its address for notice by giving written notice to the other in the manner provided in these Policies and Procedures. Any such communication, notice or demand shall be deemed to have been given or served on the date personally served by personal service, on the date of confirmed dispatch if by electronic communication, or on the date shown on the return receipt or other evidence if delivered by mail.</b>


<b><label>Severability</label> — Should any portion of these Policies and Procedures or the Promoter Terms and Conditions, or any other instrument or document referred to herein or issued by the Company, be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the balance of all of such shall remain in full force and effect.</b>


<b><label>Limitation of Damages</label> — TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE COMPANY AND ITS PROMOTERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER REPRESENTATIVES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR, AND PROMOTER HEREBY RELEASES THE FORGOING FROM AND WAIVES, ANY CLAIM FOR LOSS OF PROFIT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF ANY CLAIM WHATSOEVER RELATING TO THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE, NON-PERFORMANCE, ACT OR OMISSION WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP OR OTHER MATTERS BETWEEN ANY PROMOTER AND THE COMPANY, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR STRICT LIABILITY. Furthermore, it is agreed that any damages to Promoter shall not exceed, and is hereby expressly limited to, the amount of the unsold products and/or services owned by the Promoter and any commissions, overrides and bonuses owed to the Promoter.</b>


<b><label>Entire Agreement</label> — This statement of Policies and Procedures which is incorporated into the Associate Agreement (Terms and Conditions), along with the Company’s Compensation Plan, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties regarding their business relationship.</b>
Some states do not allow the limitation of liability, so this provision may not apply to you.

                <h2>Information Sharing.</h2>&nbsp;Vivacity uses the information we collect solely for our business purposes. We do not sell or share personal information to third parties other than those third parties who provide services vital to our business (see Third-Party Providers, below) and to other Distributors (see Other Distributors, below) in your organization. However, we may also provide aggregate information and statistics about our customers, sales and related site-information to our third party vendors, but this information and statistics will include no personally identifying information. Please note that we may release information in good faith as is reasonably necessary to comply with the law or protect our rights.
                <br /><br />

                <h2>Third-Party Providers.</h2>&nbsp;Vivacity uses the services of third-party providers for certain services. In order for these third parties to perform their functions, we must provide certain of your personal information to them. These providers include merchant processing, website hosting service, delivery service providers, product return processors, and software providers.<br /><br />

                <h2>Other Distributors.</h2> As a network marketing company, Vivacity provides certain information to Distributors regarding the other Distributors and Customers enrolled in a Distributor’s sales organization. If you enroll as a Distributor with Vivacity, your name, title, email address, and telephone number will be provided to other Distributors in your upline and downline. No other personally identifiable information will be shared with other Distributors.<br /><br />

                <h2>Security.</h2> Whether you place an order or create a profile, our hosting service uses the industry-standard secure server software (SSL) that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to the server. In addition, all of the customer data collected is protected against unauthorized access. Credit card numbers are stored by our software hosting provider.
                <br /><br />


                No data transmission over the Internet will be 100% secure. While we take steps to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. Upon receiving your transmission, we make all reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems. However, you are ultimately responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your username, passwords and/or any account information.<br /><br />

                To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https."<br /><br />

                Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don’t permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders. In that case, you’ll be unable to connect to the server, which means you won’t be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our order form and place your order by phone or by fax.<br /><br />
